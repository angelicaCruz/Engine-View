**Scenario**
```
Users share a commone scene that features an Engine. 

Each user can select a part of the engine and a line will be drawn from the user's position to the selected object's position. The lines will be then made available to other connected devices. 

To see the lines, users can open their own Menu and select "Show Lines" to make line visibles and "Hide Lines" to hide them. 

Users can also decide if they want to save the line they created for later use with "Save Lines" from the block menu. "Load Lines' can be used to make previously created lines appear. These two procedures uses a Json file. They are also subject to improvement as for now the Json file is device dependendent.
